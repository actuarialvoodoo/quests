# Proposing a project

To propose a project and recruit collaborators, simply open an issue with a brief description (with as much details as you feel comfortable sharing) then submit a pull request to update `README.md` with the project name and the name of the primary contact. A link to the project repo should be included as soon as the researchers feel comfortable sharing the code publicly.

# Project guidelines

We aim to be as inlcusive as possible, but here are a few requirements to ensure the projects are aligned with our mission:

1. Whenever possible, utilize publicly available data. If proprietary data is required, attempt to perform some experiments with simulated data.
2. When the preprint is available, the source code for experiments must also be open sourced and be made available on GitHub.
3. The researchers agree to submit the paper to a journal or venue where the accepted manuscript can be made publicly available. This can mean an open access journal, a journal with an open access option (with the option selected by the authors), a conference hosted on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/), or a journal that allows the accepted version to be uploaded to a preprint server.
4. Preprints should be submitted to [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/), as SSRN introduces friction for access by requiring registration in some cases.

We emphasize that the project collaborators have full control of when materials are shared, e.g. they may release code only when the first preprint is made available, but they should intend to achieve full reproducibility in the final result.
